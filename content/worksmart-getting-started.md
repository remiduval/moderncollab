## Purpose

**What does the Work Smart app do?**

Work Smart is a powerful chat bot available to people using Microsoft Teams, to quickly become proficient with Microsoft's productivity and collaboration tools. 

The app quickly becomes the one-stop-shop for Office 365 knowledge, saving people time from searching vast amounts of internet pages.  

**Who can use the Work Smart app?**

The Work Smart app is built for everyone!

For organisations - The app supports your Office 365 adoption activities. It can reduce burden on IT support and Champions by providing a low-cost alternative to human resource. Available on-demand, the bot triages “How do I…?”, “Tell me about…” style questions.

For people - the app is where people of all skill levels can learn more about Office 365 tools. For beginners, simply navigate the menu to quickly uncover popular features. For experts, type your question for a response.

**Is the Work Smart app free?**

Yes, for the moment the Work Smart app is completely free.  

However, we will implement a subscription model during the second half (H2) of 2021.  This will allow us to cover costs for infrastructure, maintenance, and further development.  

## Installation

**Installing or removing the Work Smart app as an individual user**

You can install the Work Smart app directly from the Microsoft Teams app store.  In the Teams desktop client, to the bottom-left click the "Apps" icon. 

*Note: If you can't see the app, this is because your organisation has restricted store apps.  In this case, you will need to speak to an IT admin to [allow the app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/manage-apps#allow-and-block-apps){target="_blank"}.* 

When you want to remove the app, in the Teams left navigation bar, right-click the app and click "Uninstall"

**Install and pin the Work Smart app for all employees**

You can install the Work Smart app for all employees in your organisation.  This means that the app is available for all and does not need to be individually downloaded for each person.  

An IT admin will need to [manage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies) to do this.  

## How-to

**Navigating the menu buttons**

When you first use the Work Smart app, you'll notice some buttons.  You can use these buttons to navigate the app.

If you are new to Office 365 and its tools, you can use the main menu to navigate through the options available to you.  This way you can explore the Office 365 capabilities and learn something new.

**Asking the questions**

If you have an idea of what it is you want to know about the Office 365 tools, you can ask a question.  Simply write your question in the chat box and the Work Smart app will come back with an answer.  

The more "natural" your question is, the better.  Ask something like "How can I enable live captions in a Teams meeting?", or "Tell me about uploading videos to Stream", or "What does PowerPoint presenter coach do?".

**Using the app across devices**

Once installed, the Work Smart app is available on any device you are logged into Microsoft Teams, 24/7.  If you start a conversation on one device, you can easily pick up where you left off on another device.
