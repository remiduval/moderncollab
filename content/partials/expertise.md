      **About communications**


      Something we can all do, but do we always get it right?


      **Benefit of getting it right (you’ll know…)**


      1. What is the story you want your people to get excited about?

      3. A clear picture of how, when and what you’ll need to communicate

      1. What kind of new skills people will need, and how you will deliver that in an incremental way
