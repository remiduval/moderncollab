      **About strategy and planning**


      Laying the foundations, understanding what it is you’re about to do and how you’re going to do it. Strategy and planning is the most important part of any project.


      **Benefit of getting it right (you’ll know…)**


      * How your project will directly link to, and drive strategic business goals

      * How you want to change and what the future looks like

      * The types of people you’ll be working with

      * How to get your organisation and people from A to B

      * How to measure you’re getting to where you want to be


      **Where ModernCollab. fits in**


      Of course we’ll bring a wealth of experience and knowledge from doing Modern Collaboration with other organisations. We’ll help you plan out the success of the objectives you have in mind. We’ll educate you on things you maybe didn’t know. We’ll help you link all of that to strategic goals, business needs and all in a way the people who matter will understand.
  - name: Use cases

      **About use cases**


      You need to change - but what do you need to change? Which changes will have maximum impact, most benefit and greater return? Use cases are the glue between strategic goals and the way technology is implemented.


      **Benefit of getting it right (you’ll know…)**


      * Where your high-value productivity and collaboration scenarios lie within your organisation

      * What people love and hate about the way they work

      * Where to begin, what to plan for later and what to forget about

      * How you can adapt your tools to best fit users needs

      * What you need to do to take users on a journey from traditional working to Modern Collaboration


      **Where ModernCollab. fits in**


      Having worked across a variety of industries, we’ll speak in a language that makes sense to your organisation. We’ll come with ideas of common scenarios you’ll want to explore. We’ll help you reach across departments and groups to write their story. We’ll layer that with knowledge of how tools can be adapted to best fit those discovered needs.
  - name: Communications
    icon: /assets/uploads/conversation.svg

      **About communications**


      Something we can all do, but do we always get it right? Communications forms the basis of keeping everyone in the loop about what it is we’re doing. Communication is key!


      **Benefit of getting it right (you’ll know…)**


      * What the story is you’ll tell to people of all levels to explain why we are here, and why we need to change

      * What the key messages are that you’ll want to tell people , and how they adapt towards different people

      * What makes each person you’re going to come-across tick, and how to grab their attention

      * The most effective channels of communication in every form the appear in

      * How, when and when you’ll communicate


      **Where ModernCollab. fits in**


      One size does not fit all, and communications is no different. We’ll help you understand what you need to be telling people. We’ll support you in telling that story in a way that makes sense. We’ll translate any tech-talk to every day language. We’ll make sure that people know what they need to know, when they need to know it.
  - name: Training

      **About training**


      Just like communications, one size does not fit all. News flash: Training does not equal adoption! Training is the activity of upskilling people to be able to work in a new way.


      **Benefit of getting it right (you’ll know…)**


      * Who you need to train and when you’ll need to train them

      * What kind of new skills people will need, and how you will deliver that in an incremental way

      * All the different ways in which you’ll train people and most importantly where

      * How you’ll follow-up with people and give them the resources they need

      * How you’ll adapt your training plan given feedback and any sudden changes that arise


      **Where ModernCollab. fits in**


      In a modern world, it’s not all about expensive classroom training. We’ll help you deliver effective upskilling remotely to wide groups or specific teams. We’ll deliver those skills with a story that makes sense to the audience. We’ll give people the knowledge they need, so they leave having learned a better way of working. We’ll provide you with guides and resources for people to self-learn. And most importantly we’ll do it all with the most current information and make sure it’s always up-to-date.
  - name: Champions network
    icon: /assets/uploads/network.svg

      **About champions networks**


      Every organisation has advocates, super-users and those people who are ahead of the curve. They often dedicate their time (above their role) to help others and spread success. Champions are the eyes, ears and hands of any successful project (and beyond).


      **Benefit of getting it right (you’ll know…)**


      * How to reach out to specific parts of the organisation when you need

      * Who you can reach out to in order to validate a change that is about to happen

      * When things aren’t going right, what those issues are and how people feel about it

      * How to cascade messages throughout the organisation and specific needs of each area

      * How to best provide on-going support for when the project closes


      **Where ModernCollab. fits in**


      Champions are often seen as a luxury resource as they have day jobs. However they are vital to success. That’s why we’ll help you on-board your champions quickly. We’ll give them the necessary skills they need to be experts. We’ll define a plan of how we all meet, when they communicate and how we can all work together.
  - name: Go-live and beyond

      **About go-live and beyond**


      Life doesn’t stop once the project closes. The fun has only just begun! People will still require support. We’ll need to continue to improve and go faster.


      **Benefit of getting it right (you’ll know…)**


      * How you’ll move any project activities into general day-to-day business

      * In what way you’ll continue to support people to keep momentum going

      * Where you’ll need to tweak what’s already been done

      * How you can start to build upon the success you have already had

      * That you’ll need to continue to shout about your success!


      **Where ModernCollab. fits in**


      We can help you understand why you aren’t quite where you expected to be. We’ll also help you make continual improvement a habit. We can also provide that buffer of support between project life and business as usual life. We can help you understand what worked well, what needs improving and which direction to take next.
