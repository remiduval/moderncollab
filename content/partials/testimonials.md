  - name: Kieran Kelly
    position: Director of Client Services at Future Worx
    quote: '*"Dan has been an incredible asset to our Team since joining in March.
      His deep Microsoft 365 knowledge and practical, can-do approach gave us
      total confidence that our client and internal projects were in good hands.
      Dan managed the design and build of our very first MS Teams bot (which has
      been a huge success) and delighted clients including BCG, Office for
      Nuclear Regulation and a Welsh fire service. Dan is an absolute pleasure
      to work with, listens well, learns fast and has great ideas."*'

  - name: Elina Oost
    position: Digital Workplace Specialist
    quote: "*\"Dan is a true do-er... Where there’s a will there’s a way could be
      Dan’s motto. Dan built deep knowledge of Zoom collaboration software he
      did not know previously, and in no time he became an expert. He also
      learned how to build and manage a bot and made it available on the MS App
      Store (if you’ve never done that, believe me it is an achievement). Dan is
      also an expert on MS accessibility features. One of Dan’s great quality's
      is his ability to explain things in a simple and patient manner, and adapt
      the way he speaks to the person in front of him. Furthermore, Dan is a
      very nice person to work with, easy to approach, with a positive and calm
      vibe and impeccable manners.\"*"

  - quote: '"Enthusiasm and a can-do approach is what I first noticed when I started
      working with Dan. We worked together for over a year and Dans knowledge of
      Office365 helped tremendously with the deployment of this suite to some
      17k users. Thank you Dan. Great job!"'

    quote: '"Dan’s ability to quickly up-skill to SME status was crucial to the
      success of our project launch throughout EMEA. As our main point of
      contact for the EMEA region, Dan reported significant findings to me
      directly. Delivering to a consistently high standard, clients regularly
      fed back was positive outcomes. Whilst working as a global team, Dan’s
      commitment and contribution made our team feel as if distance was no
      object. I feel that Dan excelled at leading our EMEA engagements and it
      would certainly be a pleasure to have him back on the team."'
