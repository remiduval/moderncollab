    position: Director of Client Services at Future Worx
    quote: '*"Dan has been an incredible asset to our Team since joining in March.
      His deep Microsoft 365 knowledge and practical, can-do approach gave us
      total confidence that our client and internal projects were in good hands.
      Dan managed the design and build of our very first MS Teams bot (which has
      been a huge success) and delighted clients including BCG, Office for
      Nuclear Regulation and a Welsh fire service. Dan is an absolute pleasure
      to work with, listens well, learns fast and has great ideas."*'

      working with Dan. We worked together for over a year and Dans knowledge of
      Office365 helped tremendously with the deployment of this suite to some
      17k users. Thank you Dan. Great job!"'

    quote: '"Dan’s ability to quickly up-skill to SME status was crucial to the
      success of our project launch throughout EMEA. As our main point of
      contact for the EMEA region, Dan reported significant findings to me
      directly. Delivering to a consistently high standard, clients regularly
      fed back was positive outcomes. Whilst working as a global team, Dan’s
      commitment and contribution made our team feel as if distance was no
      object. I feel that Dan excelled at leading our EMEA engagements and it
      would certainly be a pleasure to have him back on the team."'

    quote: '"Dan is one of the most reliable and consistent consultants I have
      worked with. He has an appreciation of all corners of a business problem
      and works well across a dynamic project team. He has great client-facing
      skills and can trust him to get high-quality work done in tight restraints
      - a great relief to project manager life. It was great working with Dan in
      an IT team and would happily recommend him for any consultancy position in
      any technology."'
