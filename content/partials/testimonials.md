      *"Dan has been an incredible asset to our Team since joining in March. His
      deep Microsoft 365 knowledge and practical, can-do approach gave us total
      confidence that our client and internal projects were in good hands.* 


      *Dan managed the design and build of our very first MS Teams bot (which has been a huge success) and delighted clients including BCG, Office for Nuclear Regulation and a Welsh fire service.* 


      *Dan is an absolute pleasure to work with, listens well, learns fast and has great ideas. "*

    quote: >-
      *"I worked with Dan for 18 months during 2018-19 in his capacity as
      Customer Success Manager at Microsoft. Dan was absolutely instrumental in
      helping me shape and launch the Thomas Cook Digital Academy, a core focus
      of which was the global adoption of Office 365.* 


      *Together we achieved some remarkable results in a very short time and in September 2019 (sadly the point at which Thomas Cook went into liquidation) we were in the top 10 adopters of MS Teams in the UK, an outcome Thomas Cook could not have achieved without Dan's support, guidance and expertise.* 


      *I would highly recommend Dan to any organisation looking for an exceptional management consultant, thought leader and digital capability/adoption expert. He's extremely easy to work with and consistently delivered time and again on our project."*

      *"Dan is a true do-er... Where there’s a will there’s a way could be Dan’s
      motto.* 


      *Dan built deep knowledge of Zoom collaboration software he did not know previously, and in no time he became an expert. He also learned how to build and manage a bot and made it available on the MS App Store (if you’ve never done that, believe me it is an achievement). Dan is also an expert on MS accessibility features.* 


      *One of Dan’s great quality's is his ability to explain things in a simple and patient manner, and adapt the way he speaks to the person in front of him. Furthermore, Dan is a very nice person to work with, easy to approach, with a positive and calm vibe and impeccable manners."*

      *"Enthusiasm and a can-do approach is what I first noticed when I started
      working with Dan.* 


      *We worked together for over a year and Dans knowledge of Office365 helped tremendously with the deployment of this suite to some 17k users. Thank you Dan.* 


      *Great job!"*
