  ModernCollab.'s mission is to help organisations of all shapes and sizes get
  the most from their Digital Collaboration tools. These hefty investments are
  often underutilised, and mostly confuse people even more - outweighing any
  kind of productivity gain or benefit.\

  Founded and run by Dan Burling, ModernCollab. looks to bring a unique skillset that bridges business needs with IT know-how. Far too often, Modern Workplace and Digital Collaboration projects are run with a pure technology head. Do these statements sound familiar?
